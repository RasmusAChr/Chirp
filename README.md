# Chirp
## Preface
This project is part of our course on Analysis, Design, and Software Architecture at the IT University of Copenhagen.
This project was originally developed in collaboration with four other contributors as part of our course. After the course ended, I made additional modifications independently. These changes were made solely by me and do not necessarily reflect the views or approval of the other contributors.
